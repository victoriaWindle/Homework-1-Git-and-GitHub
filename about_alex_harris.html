	<h1>Hi, I'm Alex.</h1>
	<h3>She/Her</h3>
		<h4>I'm often miscontrued as a guy on paper. This has brought on many funny real-life introductions in my life, so I figured I'd get that out of the way, first.</h4>

	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I'm an avid tea-drinker, but I also enjoy the occasional coffee -- with cashew milk! I used to despise coffee, but after working as a Barista for 6 years in the city of Toronto, it grew on me. Living in Toronto brought me closer to people from all walks of life, and gave me a greater understanding of culture as well as a great appreciation for those who celebrate it. I love the arts, particularly sculpture and dance. I thoroughly enjoy live music, probably because I'm not-so musically inclined, but that's never stopped me from dancing. These days, I prefer to stay in as opposed to going out -- do we really have a choice anymore? -- and have moved back to my hometown to spend more quality time with family. When I lived in the city it seemed like life never slowed down, which was very exciting, but not as exhiliarating to me as nature. I love to get my hands dirty in the garden, growing my own food is like a form of therapy. When you get to cook and bake with your crop, that takes the cake! I love being in the kitchen, so I find the two work well together. I have a big family, but I'm the oldest of my generation in my family. I've found that's put a lot of extra responsibility on my shoulders, but that also meant I got to make a lot of the decisions. This lead to my interest in video games, console and desktop. Not having an older sibling to hog them all of the time really helped, too, and I'm sure my brother didn't mind when he was finally old enough to play. My sisters, who are twins, came next, followed by my youngest sister -- and then my mom said she'd had it! My mom is one of my greatest role models in life, she reminds me how resilient we can be as humans and that we have so much power, and to use that to empower others. I'm really excited to delve deeper into the development field. I turned 27 this year and told myself I had to stop thinking about it and just go for it! So here I am.
